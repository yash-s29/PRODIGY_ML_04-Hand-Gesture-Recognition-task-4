#PRODIGY_ML_04-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-task-4#

Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

#Hand Gesture Recognition#

#Overview
This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately classify different hand gestures from images, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction. The model is trained to recognize gestures representing the letters A-Z, space, and nothing.

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the ASL Alphabet from Kaggle. It consists of images representing the American Sign Language (ASL) letters, as well as additional classes for space and nothing.

#Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized as follows:

-Train/: Contains 28 images of gestures for A-Z, Space, and Nothing.

-Test/: Contains images to evaluate the model's performance.

#Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
OpenCV

#Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yash-s29/PRODIGY_ML_04-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-task-4.git
Change to the project directory: cd PRODIGY_ML_04-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-task-4
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage
Prepare your images in the Train/ and Test/ folders.
Run the script: python Hand_Gesture.py
The predictions for the test images will be saved in submission.csv.

#Model Training
The model uses MobileNetV2 for transfer learning, with data augmentation applied to the training dataset. The training is performed using sparse categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

#Output
The final output of the model includes predictions for each test image, which are stored in submission.csv in the format: filename,label image1.png,A image2.png,B ...
